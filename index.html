Ecologically  relevant,  dynamic  and functional  traits,  such  as  taxon  specific pigment  composition  of  phytoplankton  as  a determinant  of  primary  production  and  the taxon-specific  composition  of  essential lipids  (in  particular  fatty  acids)  in  the phytoplankton community affected plankton  community  dynamics,  e.g.  the food  quality  dependent  trophic  transfer efficiency  to zooplankton  in “wild nature”. We  were  able  to  demonstrate  that experimental  reductions  in  phytoplankton diversity  resulted  also  in  a  loss  of functional  traits,  which  directly  determined changes  in  phytoplankton  performance. Altered  pigment  composition  (CHEMTAX analyses,  Ilic  et  al.  submitted  to  Limnol. Oceanogr.  Methods,  Fig.  2)  resulted  in different photosynthetic activity and spectral  light  use  efficiency  (Gollnisch  et al.  2017,  in prep.  Fig.  3).  Diversity  reduced phytoplankton  communities  showed  lower light  use  efficiencies,  mainly  in  wave length  bands  were  algal  group  specific accessory  pigments  absorb  light.    Further, the  phytoplanktons  composition  in  fatty acids  essential  to  zooplankton  nutrition was  found  to  depend  strongly  on  the biodiversity of the phytoplankton community  (Fig.  4  A,  Stockenreiter  et  al.  in prep.).  With  decreasing  diversity  in phytoplankton, we detected lower amounts  total  PUFA  content  and  the occurrence of  certain  essential  fatty  acids. 3)  We  further  demonstrated  that  our experimental  shifts  in  the  diversity  of functional  traits  of  natural  phytoplankton (in  our  case  pigments  and  fatty  acids)  had consequences for composition: Lower zooplankton content of phytoplankton  diversity  related  PUFAs was  linked  to  lower  growth  of  cladocerans, resulting  in  shifts  of  the  copepod  : cladocera  ratio  in  the  zooplankton.  These shifts were  only  correlated  with  the nutritional complementarity phytoplankton communities of for zooplankton  and  independent  of  changes in  phytoplankton  biomass  (Fig.  4  B,C).  This had  so  far  only  been  found  for  laboratory studies  with  either  single  species  or  very low  diversity  communities  (Brzezinski  and von  Elert  2007;  von  Elert  2004).  The resulting zooplankton (consumer) community  shifts  could  be  observed  in zooplankton biomass, composition  and  diversity.
